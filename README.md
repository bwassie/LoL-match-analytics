# League of Legends match analytics

This is a small project I'm working on to improve my data scraping and SQL skills. The question I'm trying to answer in the context of professional League of Legends matches is: what are the differences between the regions? In particular, what separates the LCK (Korea) from NA (North America). This is currently a work in progress but I plan to update it weekly, if nore more frequently.   
`webscrape_tables.ipynb` covers the data scraping portion while `2017_NA_vs_LCK_analysis.ipynb` covers some of the analysis. The folder `utils` contains the utilities I used to make some of the SQL querying and data processing easier.
