# League of Legends match analytics
This is a small project I'm working on to improve my data scraping and SQL skills. The question I'm trying to answer in the context of professional League of Legends matches is: what are the differences between the regions? In particular, what separates the LCK (Korea) from NA or EU (North America and Europe). This is currently a work in progress but I plan to update it weekly, if nore more frequently.
