    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends is a competitive video game owned by Riot Games in which 10 players compete against each other in teams of 5. It is one of the most played and viewed video games in the world. Since 2011, Riot Games has hosted professional \"leagues\" in various regions around the world. The best teams from each region come to the Wold Championship where the best team wins the Summoner's Cup. Since its inception, the World Championship has been dominated by the Korean teams. This is an attempt to apply data driven methods to find latent variables that can explain the Korean dominance in professional League of Legends matches. All of the data has been kindly provided by [Tim Sevenhuysen](https://twitter.com/TimSevenhuysen) on his website: [Oracle's Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/).\n",

    "European teams have made it into the top 5 in 2015 and 2016 but Korean teams have been 3 out of the top 5 teams consistently. Since 2013, Korean teams have also won the World Championship. There has been much speculation about the Korean dominance in the professional League of Legends circuit. In particular, many people have wondered why North America never seems to make it into the top 5 despite having the largest recruiting pool and the most enthusiastic fan base. I will try to answer the question by analyzing matches from the LCK (Korean circuit) and NA (North American circuit). Specifically, I will be comparing LCK with NA matches. I unfortunately only have complete match data for the 2016 and 2017 seasons so I will be limited to the last couple of years. I will start with 2017 first since it is more recent and is not too different in terms of gameplay changes to 2018. Lets see what we can find! \n",
    "### Choosing teams\n",
    "In order to make a fair comparison between the two regions, I have to pick teams that I believe best represent these regions. I decided to use teams that made it to the Spring or Summer season playoffs in the respective years. If a team made it to either of the playoffs that year, that means they must have been better than at least half the teams in their region in that season since only half the teams that compete in a region move to the playoffs. Thus, I will be comparing the top 50% of Korean teams with the top 50% of North American teams in that same year. First let's get the 2017 matches for playoff teams in LCK and NA. I have custom scripts that parse my databases and give me the matches I want. The specific implementation can be found in `parsing_utils.py`. \n",

    "This gives a clearer picture about what's going on. The top 3 NA teams tend to have a higher GSPD than the rest of the NA teams that qualified for playoffs whereas the LCK playoff teams tend to have a high GSPD in general. Again, this supports the notion that NA is more competitive than the LCK; the LCK teams that make it to the playoffs tend to dominate the field (according to the GSPD) whereas the NA teams tend to be more of a mixed bag. That seems interesting. Lets see if we can find a better explanation for why this is. To evaluate which features contribute to the differences between NA and LCK, I will train several models (Logistic Regression, Adaboost with Decision Trees, and Random Forest) and perform an anova to distinguish between matches in NA and LCK. Then I will see which features are the most important in distinguishing between the two groups.  \n",

The testing set will be used for 10 fold cross validation and the testing set will be used to calculate the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUC). Then I extract the top 10 ranked features (for Adaboost, and RandomForest) or the features that had the largest coefficients (for Logistic Regression) and examine them. The coeficients for Logistic Regression normally aren't easy to interpret since different features can have different scales. However, since my features will be normalized to 0, I'm hoping that I can just use the coeficients for each feature to determine their importance to the classificaiton"
